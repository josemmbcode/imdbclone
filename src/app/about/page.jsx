        IMDb (an abbreviation of Internet Movie Database) is an online database
        of information related to films, television series, music videos,
        podcasts, home videos, video games, and streaming content online â€“
        including cast, production crew and personal biographies, plot
        summaries, trivia, ratings, and fan and critical reviews. IMDb began as
        a fan-operated movie database on the Usenet group "rec.arts.movies" in
        1990, and moved to the Web in 1993. Since 1998, it is now owned and
        operated by IMDb.com, Inc., a subsidiary of Amazon.{" "}
